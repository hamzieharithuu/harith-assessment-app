# Two Q Alliance Software Developer (Laravel) Preliminary Assessment
Assalamualaikum & Hi. My name is Muhammad Harith Hamzie bin Abdul Latif.

First of all, I would like to thank Two Q Alliance Sdn Bhd for giving me the opportunity to complete this assessment.  
I have completed the assigned tasks and this repository contains my solution for your review.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP >= 8.4
- Composer
---

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzieharithuu/harith-assessment-app.git
cd harith-assessment-app
```
2. Install PHP dependencies
```bash
composer install
```
3. Create a .env file (you can copy from .env.example) and set up your database credentials.
Generate application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
4. Link storage folder:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```
5. Start the development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
I already include storage/app/public/logos and .sqlite file for testing (since this is a dummy project & doesn't hold any live production sensitive data) 
Thank you.
